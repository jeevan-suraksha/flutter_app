## Abstract of our app
Human history is observing a very strange time fighting an invisible enemy; the novel 
COVID-19 coronavirus. India as a nation is striving desperately to eradicate this threat from 
the face of our nation, the center has ordered all the states and union territories to impose a 
strict lockdown throughout the country, in this dreadful situation the proper functioning of 
shops and stores is one of the cornerstones in our fight against novel covid-19. During the 
course of this lockdown one of the major problems that we identified was that there have 
been many incidents where people have crowded in front of various shops and stores hence 
these places may easily serve as a hotspot where the novel covid-19 can spread its wings, 
so it becomes an absolute necessity to maintain social distancing in these places and this 
will serve as our primary objective in this project.
 Our team consists of four undergraduates pursuing a degree in computer science 
and engineering , Our project mainly focuses on creating an app that helps in keeping the 
traffic in these places under check by projecting the location of smartphones carried by the 
people in the vicinity of these shops and stores.


 An additional functionality is added to this app which enables the customers to freely 
chat with the vendors regarding any of their queries which in turn helps in reducing the 
unnecessary movement of people and hence effectively reducing the traffic in these areas.
According to our estimates our project will need a funding of around â‚¹10,000 which will vary 
with the number of users using the application.
